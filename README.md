# Agricultural-Marketing-Dashboard

We have implemented a system that would make use of the Information about the prices of the Agricultural Commodities in markets across different regions in India and provide certain meaningful insights along certain aspects. Such that because of these functionalities of this system, it would be extremely useful for the users to get useful insights that would influence their decisions taken during the entire process of farming the crops to selling them.

All the details of our system, from the ER diagram to the data preprocessing to the SQL queries in the backend, can be found in the **Report.pdf** file. The zip file here corresponds to the codes that are used here. These codes can also be found in the directory **Group_16**.

In that directory, there are codes for the front end and there is the data dump as well. We created the front-end of our website by making use of Flask. The backend scripts were run using PostgreSQL-13. In that directory, the video file of **Group_16.mp4** can also be found which is actually a demo to the system where we walk through the different aspects of our system, our implementations, and their usability.
